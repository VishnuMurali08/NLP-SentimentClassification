# NLP-SentimentClassification
A machine learning project for sentiment classification using advanced NLP techniques and pre-trained models. This project leverages TensorFlow, Transformers, and text preprocessing pipelines to classify sentiments from textual data efficiently

# Sentiment Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying text sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging pre-trained models, such as those provided by TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers, this project implements a robust pipeline for sentiment analysis. 

The goal is to provide a streamlined approach to text sentiment classification, suitable for various real-world applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and review sentiment evaluation.

## Features

- End-to-end pipeline for text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Use of pre-trained NLP models for efficient sentiment classification.
- Visualization of key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Extensible for custom datasets and fine-tuning.
